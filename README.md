# Mazerator
Mazerator game for Weekly Game Jam Week #126, but failed to submit on time https://awesomekalin.itch.io/mazerator
Please note that nightly builds aren't nightly. These are actually builds that I do after a commit.
Don't believe what is says about what it's programmed with.

If you want to install old versions of Mazerator, goto github.com/Awesome-Arcade/Mazerator-old/releases or download osetup.exe: https://gitlab.com/awesome-arcade/waterbug-studios/mazerator/-/raw/master/osetup.exe
